# The fella
Very early days, still trying to figure out what tools I want to use, leaning towards rust to keep it quick, and I want to use an old xbox one kinect for the hardware, but getting that to work with linux/windows without bringing in a bunch of deps seems anoying.

I need to do more reaserch into the tools that already exist and their short-commings. Hopefully this doesn't die lmao
